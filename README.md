# Master thesis project

 This master's thesis project covers the entire process of training and evaluating multiple neural networks for assessing the ground cover of plants and weeds using semantic 
 segmentation. Specifically, we started by selecting datasets and then moved on to training and evaluating six combinations of encoders and decoders, exploring different training 
 settings to mitigate the problem of highly unbalanced datasets. Finally, the models were compared with each other to determine the best combination.
